# DBMS-with-JDBC
(DBMS) is a complex set of software programs that controls the organization, storage, management, and retrieval of data in a 
database. DBMS are categorized according to their data structures or types. The DBMS accepts requests for data from the 
application program and instructs the operating system to transfer the appropriate data. On the other hand, Extensible 
Markup Language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in machine readable form. It is defined in the XML 1.0 
Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all gratis open standards.

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) provides Java developers with a standard API that is used to access databases, 
regardless of the driver and database product. JDBC presents a uniform interface to databases - change vendors and your 
applications only need to change their driver.
This is a DataBase Management System(DBMS) that is an application that interacts with the user who is allowed to store 
and manage data in a database using SQL , with Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) which access the databases with a 
standard API regardless of the driver or the database.

### DBMS Objectives
##### 1.Design an object oriented XML-based DBMS.
##### 2.Getting familiar with SQL and XML parsing.
##### 3.Draw a UML class diagram that represents your model.
##### 4.Apply different design patterns to your model.

### JDBC API Objectives

##### 1.Implements JDBC standard interface.

##### 2.Integrate JDBC interface with your earlier DBMS implementation.

##### 3.Apply different design patterns to your model.

##### 4.Extend your previously written code and augment it with new features.
